The following program is meant to help me record my time after studying.

Update #1: 
So far there have been no developments, as I'm struggling to create the interface of the program itself. For one, I don't have an idea of what the program is going to look like, nor am I capable of creating the design itself using a tool I have knowledge of using. I think as I develop the app, I will learn as I go, but the GUI of the app is challenging to imagine so this will surely take some time and effort.

Update #2:
I'm just going to reset everything. I'll just make a RPG.

Update #3:
A timer has been added to the game. Now I need to make it so that stopping the timer will trigger a 25XP increase in the level system of the game.
